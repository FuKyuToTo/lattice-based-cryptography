# lattice-based-cryptography
Our codes are protable implementations of lattice-based cryptosystems using JavaScript.
We investigated and implemented five recent lattice-based encryption schemes and public-key exchange protocols including Lizard/ring-Lizard, Kyber, Frodo, and NewHope, which are the active candidates of post-quantum cryptography due to their applicabilities and efficiencies.
