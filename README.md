# Lattice-based-cryptography
Our codes are portable implementations of lattice-based cryptosystems using JavaScript.
We investigated and implemented five recent lattice-based encryption schemes and public-key exchange protocols including Lizard/ring-Lizard, Kyber, Frodo, and NewHope, which are the active candidates of post-quantum cryptography due to their applicabilities and efficiencies. The references of these lattice-based cryptosystems are in the directory ref/.

The purpose of our code is to provide the research community a tool to verify, analyze and reproduce the statements made in our paper. Our manuscript is found at https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/9846168.
